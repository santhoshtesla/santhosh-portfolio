    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>While being asked to write about myself in school, I was totally confused as to from where to start how to write and so on.

        The entire class was on discussions on how to write such a topic. We all know about ourselves, but when somebody asks you to write, then we just get stuck with points and wonder from where to start.
        
        Well I would start introducing myself with my name. My name is Saira and I live in Chennai, India. I was born and bought up abroad in the gulf. I was born in Kuwait and was there till the age of 11. Then we shifted to India and settled down there. Though my father went back, my mother and we were back in India. We joined schools here and made lots of friends.</p>
